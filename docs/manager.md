# Dispatch Manager

One of the main features of dispatch is a fast, powerful admin tool.

It can be accessed via http at '/admin'. Create users using `python manage.py createsuperuser`.

# Creating and Editing Sections, Persons, Tags, Topics, Galleries

Use the manage menu in the top right hand corner to select the type of entity you wish to create/edit.

From this interface, entities can be created with the 'create' button on the right, or edited by selecting an existing one from the tabulation. There is a search bar for easily finding the entity you are looking for.

Fill out the form with your desired values and press save.

# Creating and Editing Articles

After creating at least one section, you can start creating articles.

Click on the 'New Article' button on the dashboard, or on the section along the top to choose an existing article to edit.

You can edit the article using the rich text editor on the left. Highlight a portion of text to bring up a menu to chose text styling options.

To insert an embedded entity, such as an image, video, quote, image gallery, widget, or to add custom html, js, or css to the article, start a new (blank) line, and press the + sign that appears to left. Select the type of embed you would like to use. Fill in the parameters that appear.

When you save an article, it is not published immediately. You must press the publish button in order for it be flagged as published.

The editor also maintains previous versions. Updating a published article will not changed the published version. You must republish the new version.

You can view previous versions by pressing the 'Version *' dropdown on the toolbar.

Also note that a slug, section, and author must be set in order for an article to be saved.

## Creating and Editing Pages

Pages are edited in a similar manner as articles, except are accessed via the pages of the manage menu. They are not associated with a section and have less optional metadata.

# Configuring Zones and Widgets

Go to the manage page and select the zone that you wish to edit. From here you can choose the widget to use in that zone.

Once a widget has been selected, various options for that widget will appear. Adjust them accordingly and press save.
