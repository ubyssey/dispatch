# Dispatch React Application

## Development

Install the required dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Run the development server:
```sh
npm run watch
```

The development server will update the `dist/dispatch-{version}.js` bundle when any changes are made to the source code. When running the Dispatch Django app in development mode, this bundle will be automatically loaded.
